To change cgenie save location, change the following locations to the new directory:

OUT_DIR in cgenie.muffin/genie-main/user.mak
OUTROOT in cgenie.muffin/genie-main/user.sh
OUTPUTDIR in cgenie.muffin/genie-main/runmuffin.sh

If this is the first time you have changed the save location,
change the following paths from relative (using ../)
to absolute (specifying entire path):

RUNTIME_ROOT in cgenie.muffin/genie-main/user.mak
RUNTIME_ROOT in cgenie.muffin/genie-main/user.sh
